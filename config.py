#This file contains the configuration variables for the app, such as database details.

# For bigger applications, you may choose to have different config.py files for testing, 
# development, and production, and put them in a config directory, making use of classes and

# and secret keys. These can be put in an instance/config.py file, which should not be pushed to 
# version control.
